## Executive Summary

Ethereum's recent network upgrades have significantly improved scalability and reduced transaction costs. The implementation of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) has reduced Layer 2 transaction costs by approximately 80%.

## Technical Improvements

### Transaction Throughput
- Average block time: 12 seconds (stable)
- Transactions per second: Increased to ~30 TPS on mainnet
- Layer 2 solutions now processing 5,000+ TPS combined

### Cost Reduction
- Average gas price: Down 60% from 2023 peak
- Layer 2 transaction costs: $0.05 average (down from $0.25)
- Mainnet transaction costs: $2.50 average (down from $15)

## Market Impact

The cost reduction has led to:

1. Increased DeFi activity on mainnet
2. Growing adoption of Layer 2 solutions
3. More accessible NFT trading
4. Enhanced developer interest in building on Ethereum

## Future Outlook

Upcoming upgrades including full Danksharding are expected to further reduce costs and increase throughput, potentially making Ethereum competitive with traditional payment networks in terms of transaction costs.
